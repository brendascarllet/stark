const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'Which commercial roof system is best for Seattle weather — TPO, PVC, or EPDM?',
    answer:
      "For most Seattle commercial buildings the answer is TPO. The white reflective surface meets WSEC cool-roof code, the heat-welded seams form a monolithic membrane that handles atmospheric river rain, and 20–25 year NDL warranties are widely available. PVC is the right call if you have grease exhaust (restaurants), chemical exposure (lab buildings), or a hospital. EPDM is fine for budget-driven projects on older buildings, but its taped/glued seams shrink with age — plan on more maintenance over the life of the roof.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a commercial flat roof cost per square foot in 2026?',
    answer:
      'Industry surveys put 2026 commercial installed pricing at roughly $7–$15/sq ft for TPO, $6–$12/sq ft for EPDM, $9–$14/sq ft for PVC, and $9–$20/sq ft for modified bitumen — all depending on tear-off, insulation R-value, parapet detailing, deck condition, and access. We provide line-item bids so you know exactly what you\'re paying for.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you install a new roof over my existing one, or do you have to tear off?',
    answer:
      "Seattle code allows up to 2 roofing layers on most commercial buildings, so a re-cover is often legal — and significantly faster and cheaper. But it only works if (1) the existing roof is dry and structurally sound, (2) it's only your first re-cover, and (3) the deck below isn't compromised. We do a moisture survey and core samples before recommending one or the other.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long will the roof project take, and will my tenants have to leave?',
    answer:
      "Most commercial re-roofs take 1–3 weeks depending on square footage, system, and insulation. Your tenants don't have to leave — we work in dry weather windows, coordinate hours that minimize noise during business hours, and stage materials so we never block access. We give you a written daily schedule before we start.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What warranty do you offer, and who backs it — you or the manufacturer?',
    answer:
      "On commercial systems, you want a manufacturer-backed warranty (not just a contractor warranty). As a GAF Certified commercial contractor we can offer GAF's System Pledge Roof Guarantee on qualifying installations — that's GAF themselves backing the labor and material together. We carry our own workmanship warranty on top of that.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you carry all required insurance and bonding for Washington commercial work?',
    answer:
      "Yes. We carry General Liability ≥ $2M, WA L&I workers' compensation, commercial auto, and we add the building owner as additional insured on every commercial project at no charge. WA contractor's license, bond, and L&I number available on request before bid.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my roof project subject to WA prevailing wage?',
    answer:
      "Only if it's a public works project. Per RCW 39.12, all Washington public works (state, county, city, school district, port, transit) require prevailing wage with weekly certified payroll filed via L&I — and there's no dollar threshold (it applies even on small jobs). Private commercial buildings are NOT subject unless public funds are involved. We can quote either way.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle ponding water, moss, and clogged drains in Seattle?',
    answer:
      'We start every project by clearing every drain and scupper, photographing existing ponding, and adding tapered insulation where the deck has settled. On install, we add cricket details around HVAC curbs and large penetrations to direct water toward drains. After install, we offer quarterly maintenance inspections — most ponding/moss problems are completely preventable with twice-a-year drain clearing and roof washing.',
