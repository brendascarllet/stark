          Woodinville's heavy tree canopy drops needles, leaves, and branches onto roofs year-round. That debris traps moisture against your shingles and feeds moss growth that shortens the life of any roof. Stark Roofing & Renovation works across Woodinville from Hollywood Hill down through the Sammamish River Valley, replacing and repairing roofs that have taken years of this kind of punishment.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Woodinville sits in a river valley surrounded by mature firs, cedars, and maples. The combination of constant shade and Pacific Northwest rain creates ideal conditions for moss and algae on roofs. Most of the homes here were built in the 1980s and 1990s, and the original roofs are past their expected lifespan. We see a lot of curling shingles, granule loss, and soft spots in the plywood from slow leaks that went unnoticed for years.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Woodinville Roofing FAQs</h3>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">How much does a roof replacement cost in Woodinville?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Most Woodinville homes run $12,000 to $25,000 depending on roof size, how many layers we tear off, and the condition of the deck underneath. Cedar shake tear-offs cost more because the material is heavier and the sheathing almost always needs repair. We give exact numbers in the estimate, not ranges.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">My roof has thick moss. Does that mean I need a full replacement?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Not always. If the shingles underneath are still flat and sealed, we can treat the moss and install zinc strips to slow regrowth. But if the moss has lifted shingle edges and water has been getting underneath for years, treatment won't undo that damage. We check the shingle condition under the moss and show you what we find.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Will wind off the Sammamish River Valley damage new shingles?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">GAF HDZ shingles are rated for 130 mph winds when installed with the full system. We use six nails per shingle in wind-prone areas and proper adhesive sealing. The failures we see from wind are usually on older 3-tab shingles that have lost their seal strips.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">How long does a Woodinville roof replacement take?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Two to four days for a standard single-family home. Steeper roofs and cedar shake tear-offs add time. We seal any exposed sections before leaving each day, regardless of the forecast.</p>
