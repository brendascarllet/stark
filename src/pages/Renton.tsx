        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Renton has some of the most varied housing stock on the south end of Lake Washington. You've got 1950s ramblers in Kennydale, split-levels in Renton Highlands from the '70s, and newer builds up on Benson Hill. Every era of home comes with its own roofing problems, and we've worked on all of them. Stark Roofing & Renovation has been replacing and repairing roofs in Renton for years, and we know what decades of PNW rain does to these homes.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Renton's older neighborhoods have roofs that survived decades of Pacific Northwest rain but are running out of time. We see cracked shingles, rusted flashing around old brick chimneys, and soft spots in the plywood deck from slow leaks that went unnoticed. The newer homes on Benson Hill deal with wind exposure and steep pitches that make proper installation critical. We fix what's underneath before we put anything new on top, because that's the part that determines whether a roof lasts.

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">My Renton home was built in the 1960s. Is the roof deck likely rotted?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Homes from that era used 1x6 skip sheathing or thin plywood, and after 60 years of rain, some of it will have soft spots. We check the deck during every tear-off and replace damaged sections before installing new shingles. The estimate includes a per-sheet price for plywood replacement so there are no surprises.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">How much does a roof replacement cost in Renton?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">A typical Renton home runs $10,000 to $22,000 for a full replacement. The range depends on square footage, roof pitch, number of layers coming off, and how much deck repair we find underneath. Flat roof sections cost more per square foot than sloped. We give exact numbers in the written estimate, broken out by line item.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">What's the difference between your flat roof options?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">EverGuard PVC is a membrane system with heat-welded seams that create a watertight bond stronger than the membrane itself. Uniflex Silicone is a coating system we apply over existing flat roofs that are still structurally sound. PVC is the full replacement, silicone is the restoration. We tell you which one fits your situation.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Can you match shingle colors for my HOA?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">GAF makes shingles in dozens of colors across three profile styles. We bring samples to the estimate so you can see them against your siding and trim. If your HOA has specific color requirements, send us the guidelines and we confirm the match before ordering materials.</p>
