const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Will my new skylight leak?',
    a: "Properly installed skylights don't leak — leaks come from bad flashing, not the skylight itself. We use the VELUX flashing kit designed for your exact roof type (composition, metal, tile) and step-flash it the right way. Every install is backed by both the VELUX No Leak warranty and our own workmanship warranty.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a permit to install a skylight?',
    a: "Most cities in King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties require a permit when you cut a new opening through the roof structure. A simple replacement (same size, same opening) usually doesn't. We handle all the permit paperwork as part of the job — you don't have to chase down your city.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you install a skylight in a metal roof?',
    a: "Yes. VELUX makes specific flashing kits for metal, tile, and composition roofs. Metal installs need extra care around the panel seams, but it's a routine job for an experienced crew. We've been doing it in the Pacific Northwest for 30+ years.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does the installation take?',
    a: "A straightforward replacement usually takes 4–6 hours. A new install with a drywall light shaft is typically a 1–2 day job. We tell you exactly what to expect during the free estimate so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do automatic (solar) skylights need power?',
    a: 'No — that\'s the whole point of the VELUX Solar Powered "Fresh Air" model. A small solar panel on the skylight charges an internal battery, so there\'s no wiring, no electrician, and no holes through your ceiling for cables. The remote control runs on a regular battery.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if it rains while my skylight is open?',
    a: "Every VELUX electric and solar-powered \"Fresh Air\" skylight has a rain sensor built in. The moment a drop hits it, the skylight closes itself — even if you're not home and even if you forgot it was open. It's the feature that sells most homeowners on going automatic.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Will adding a skylight raise my home value?',
    a: "Yes, when done well. Natural light is one of the top features buyers ask about, and a professionally installed VELUX skylight in a kitchen, bathroom, or vaulted living room consistently shows up as a value-add. The key word is \"professionally\" — a DIY install or a leaky one will hurt your value, not help it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the free estimate?",
    a: "We come to your house, look at the actual spot you want the skylight, measure the framing and roof pitch, recommend the right VELUX model for your space, and give you a written quote that breaks out the product, the labor, the flashing, the permit (if needed), and the warranty. No deposit, no obligation, no high-pressure sales.",
