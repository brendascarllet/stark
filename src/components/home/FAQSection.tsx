      question: "How much does a new roof cost in Seattle?",
      answer: "Most full asphalt-shingle roof replacements in the Greater Seattle area run between $10,350 and $25,300, depending on home size, roof pitch, tear-off layers, and deck condition. Premium materials like Grand Sequoia or standing-seam metal cost more. We provide free, no-obligation written estimates — no flat-rate phone quotes. Call (206) 739-8232 or request a quote online."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer free roof inspections?",

We'll assess your roof's condition, document any issues with photos, and provide a detailed written estimate. We serve Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma, Everett, Redmond, Kirkland, and the entire Puget Sound area."
    },
